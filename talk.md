* ?

# Book

* Dominica book, my own with Nancy Van Schooenderwoert
* End of this talk: know the five theives and how to tackle them, and inspired to make work visible

> But why care about this?

# Why care

 "Busyness is an addiction, which doesn't equate to growth or value. It usually means doing a bunch of things that all turn out crappy" - DDeG

* Our culture loves overwork and busyness and we overload ourselves - effectiveness & even efficiency be damned
* By doing so, we lose time to avoidable problems by switching and neglecting work, which is expensive & dispiriting. It's also a correlated to Burnout in the state of devops report.
* We can create habits that create a circle of healthy, sustainable and improvable work.

# Five Bandits

* If someone stole you wallet you'd notice. If someone stole your lunch you might send an email to all your colleagues trying to find the culprit. But if someone steals your time?
* (Foreach: What it is & how it appears, how it steal time, clues it leaves at the scene)

# FB: Too Much WIP

* What: Demand > capactiy -> delay, costs, quality & irratable staff
* Why: 'yes' -> team, fear, shiny, unsure size, please people
* How: Context switching, neglected, wait times
* Clues: Switch, quality, 'yes', cycletime, mastery missing (it's elusive)

# FB: Unknown Deps

* What: 3 types: Software/Hardware (API, cloud), expertise/authorisation, Activity(db restore).
* Why: "Every dep doubles your chances of being delayed or late"  - Troy Magennis 
* How: Blocked work, Unplanned work -> it's expesive when you don't know
* Clues: High Coordination, folk aren't available when you need, unexpected changes to code/plan causes another thing

# FB: Unplanned Work

* What: Work that you didn't expect to be doing. It's important but skipped the planning stage
* Why: Increases uncertainty & removes predictability. Eats planned work for breakfast
* How: High WIP
* Clues: You've not your planned work 2 weeks later

# FB: Conflicting Priorities

* What: Many prorities. Most number one. Folk aren't paying attention to long things take
* Why: Prioritisation isn't happening. Starting without finishing
* How: More priority meetings for all the projects. WIP bites again. Longer cycle times.
* Clues: "My thing is high priority!", if X not done by Y, multiple when will my thing be done?

# FB: Neglected Work

* What: Like maintainece work to patch servers & tech debt. Old car -> not a problem unless you don't maintain.
* Why: It's important but not urgent. No time for important.
* How: When you least expect it.
* Clues: important neglected work becomes an emergency
