* People take on more work than the capactiy they have to do - overload teams and create bottlenecks that delays the delivery of business value

* Why? How to unmask and some examples of Kanban systems

* Why are we so overloaded?
  * Underestimate the numbers of distractions
  * Tend to say yes - should postpone them
  * It's 2:30 on Sunday and we are working on those things. Stop making Sunday the new Monday
  * we keep saying 'yes'.
  * Burnout cultures play a role, but often we do this to ourselves
  * Four reasons we say 'yes'
    * No body wants to be the person who let the team down
    * Shiny new object syndromme (Docker or prepare for an audit)
    * Everything takes longer than we think it will - especially other peoples work
    * It's easy to say yes to the boss rather than say no

* DevOps culture bit: Respect for People from Lean
  * Definition of respect is: giving honest feedback. Why they didn't get money. Why there was a problem, how do we deal with it?
  * Foundation for safety - enables improvement

* Flow is smooth and fast movement of customer value. Biggest deterrent to flow is too much WIP
 * Make work visible, reduce batch size, build quality im

* Why too much WIP deteres flow
  * No interuptions

<Story about someone on ops who wsn't delivering>

* When we take on new work faster than we finish it then we'll get slower
  * Kingman's formula
  * Servers don't let go to 100%, stop it for us 

* WIP is a leading indicator, most of our metrics are trailing indicators (cycle time whatever) - doesn't work until it's finished
* We now know why we do, and it's iplication. What do we do about it?

* Making the work visible, immediately gives someone something to view. (SHOW A BOARD - has planned and unplanned)
  * Partially completed work can be expensive
 
* Imrpvoe flow by making it visible (WHERE IS THE WORK STUCK? Masses in validate)
  * 30 days over (60 or 90 days for some of you) - ask why is it stuck?
  * Could be stuck because:
   * Unplanned work, conflicting priortiesm, dependecies

* Unplanned work
  * Interuptions -> context switch -> delay geneartion & protection (just appear in doing)
  * Can't bring it down to zero, so plan for unplanned work - so you don't get killed by it. Maintainece reduces unplanned work 

* How to mask unplanned work (always apear in doing)
  * Add a swimlane, also add maintenance 
  * Usually resistance to this: I don't have time to do a card on every intruption: CIO will want to know why things aren't working: "I'm busy"
  * THE PERFECT CRIME
  * Experiment with this for a couple of weeks. You can show it to people 

* 2 Confliecting priotities
  * My project is more important - unclear priorities
  * Competes for the same peoples time and resources if you have loads of projects. It block flow and increases WIP 
  * Everything canot be top priority - only one thing can be 
  * Example: Accoutning team. Cadence work, end of month things. Expsense reports. This competes with their other work 
  * How to unmask: Add the dates on the cards. Add a swimlane for Cadence work
  * Rather than arguing, you can see it and show why things aren't progressing. When you can see (unmasl) you can have conversations about priority

* 3. Dependencies
   * Marketing team: blog example. We work in webs of dependecies.
   * Going to restaurant example. Troy quote.
   * What to do? Team deps get hard. Card is a parent of two in an Ops teams backlog. Very expensive when teams are mutually unaware of dependenceis.
   
 * Next step: take charge
  * bring Visualise  to work
  * Limit WIP
    * Happens by setting the amount of work the team can handle at one time. The team decide this.
    * WIP limits intentionally constrain the system. It's what gives peole the permission to say no. If at 10, you have to say no. "We are full right now, sorry! Unless prod is down" 
    * WIP Limit is a friendly constraint. Food buffet, you can't eat everything. The size of the plate constrains this.
    * You may break them, but you have to do something

    * Ways to limit WIP. Fav way is to accurately reflect how much number. WIP across the whole board. Does this make sense to have 100 things?
    * Let's lower it. 80 is better than 100. Keep asking it. Keep lowering until you get smooth flow. WIP is supposed to be adjusted.
    * WIP can be on rows, at the cols,
    * Limit WIP to find problems
      * Parituall ycompleted work gieves less biz value. 
      * WIP is 80% of capacity
    
 * Problems remain: 
   * Folk take on too much work then they can do. Leaders, be aware the impact you can have here.
