# The LEGO Experiment

* I'm going to tell you about the most powerful retrospective technique I've found for improving how teams work. Which is with a set of Lego bricks like this.

* Biggest problem team. They hated me, so I went back and asked for the next biggest problem who would actually like some help.

* Team was in a state. The previous PO had burnt out so we did CoD ourselves to handle prioritisation and started saying 'no'

* We had visualised the work, found neglected, reduced WIP to 1 and completed all the neglected work.
* But at our retros we felt like a lot of our time was distracted on unplanned work
* Wanted to show stakeholders and management that we were drowning via data

# Calculate it

* Our challenge was how to make the nature of each week’s work more visible. Show ‘Failure demand’ and ‘Ad hoc’ work and time spent in meetings against planned work.
* Tried whiteboard, tried spreadsheet -> It was a chore
* Development should be fun or your doing it wrong

# Lego

* Each block represents one hour of dev time
* Those blocks are made into a 3d bar chart
* Previous weeks are kept to show the variance after we try new things

# Close up

* Each work represents
* Ran out of orange!
* Joke about glasses, children, sad little faces

# Daily Review

* Create bricks through the day. 4pm Review
* How can we stop this happening. use 5whys.

JOKE: Glasses. Also lego creating sad children faces.

# Glasgow interlude

* We had been collecting the data for over four weeks when a board room request went out
* They wanted the team to tackle two large projects. The last project had been a disaster that involved the team working the day after Christmas to tidy things up.
* The tech lead of the project said nothing. He walked up to a whiteboard, picked up a pen and wrote a number on the board.

# 23.2%

* If I say something will take 12 weeks. It means you'll get it this time next year.
* There was a stunned silence. Never had the directors been given such insight into the system of work.
* Next they came running down to the work area to see the Lego. They had the most serious conversation ever about lego bricks.

# The stats April

* They asked: How do we get the Orange away? We said it was reports. They found a way themselves to collate their reports without asking us
* They asked: How do we get the red down? We asked for a tester, as it is complex to handle this code. Also we asked for better access to folk who want things since we weren't getting the code right and revisiting work.

# The stats November

* Half a year later and the team spent most of their time on planned work. I reckon this is about average for a team.
* The failure rate was massively cut by the tester and improving the way we picked up work. We added more stakeholder demos to make sure we got things right before they hit production.
* Ad-hoc came down as we introduced a rule saying we were interruptible in two time blocks of 30 minutes during the day.

# Glasgow

* We managed to improve this team two fold. It was by concentrating on improving collaboration by working as a team.
* Please note. Our team was in a safe context. I could understand if some people didn't want their work tracked
